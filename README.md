## fm3chanic Themes for XFCE4-Terminal

This repository contains all color themes for the XFCE4 terminal emulator I've created so far.<br> 
It is the main terminal emulator of the XFCE4 desktop environment for Linux.

Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the directory "vtuber_project". The directory "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that all color themes have been originally created for Notepad++, which has the tendency to show colors lighter as they are in other applications. Therefore it might occur that the color theme is a bit on the darker side.

### Installation:

Copy the theme file to `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes` and restart the application.<br>
The theme should now be selectable in the "Colors" tab of the "Preferences" as one of the preset colorschemes

> [!NOTE]
> It might be necessary to create the directory first as `/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes` might be missing in `~/.local/share`.

### Contribution:

If you want to help maintaining the themes, please use colors from the according color scheme. You can find the scheme files in the repo linked above.
